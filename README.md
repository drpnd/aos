# AOS: Academic Operating System

## About
We are developing an operating system for my personal research
and practical education.
For the academic purpose, this motivation is similar to MINIX,
but we do not focus on theories.
Our main objective is to provide knowledges on hardware-related
programming.  This is one of the most difficult and complex parts
when we start the development of operating system from scratch.
